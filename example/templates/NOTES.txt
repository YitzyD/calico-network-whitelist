An example server and two clients have been deployed:
* Hello World Server: {{ include "example.fullname" . }}
* Blocked Client: {{ printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name "example-blocked-client" | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}
* Whitelisted Client: {{ printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name "example-whitelisted-client" | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}

The Hello World Server is behind a whitelist controlled by the calico NetworkPolicy: {{ printf "%s-%s-%s" .Release.Name .Chart.Name .Values.serverWhitelistLabel.name | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}

The Whitelisted Client pod is labeled "{{ .Values.serverWhitelistLabel.name }}: {{ .Values.serverWhitelistLabel.sourceTag }}", the label selector that is whitelisted by the Network Policy for the Hello World Server.

The clients will attempt to connect to the Hello World Server when they start.
To view the logs of each clients:
* Blocked Client: "kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=blocked-client"
* Whitelisted Client: "kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=whitelisted-client"

Try connecting to the Hello World Server from your system, and you will also be blocked:
curl -v $(kubectl get service {{ include "example.fullname" . }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'):8080

Now add your IP as a whitelist source in the values.yaml file as such:

calico-network-whitelist:
  whitelists:
  - destination:
      name: *server-label-name
      labelSelectors:
      - name: *server-label-name
        value: *server-label-destination-tag
    sources:
    - labelSelectors:
      - name: *server-label-name
        value: *server-label-source-tag
    - ips:
      - <Your-IP-Address>

 Then upgrade the release. You can now connect to the Hello World Server from your system.
